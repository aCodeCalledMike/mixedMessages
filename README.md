# mixedMessages Project

### A Text Randomizer: "NickName Generator".
Written with JavaScript, this text randomizer takes 3 inputs and returns a new random output: A funny random name.
This is following the mixed messages learning project from CodeCademy and :
+ Practice using Git and Github.
+ To share a project.
+ Work in a team.
+ to complete mixed messages project.


### How the "NickName Generator" Works.

+ It will take 3 inputs : Firstname, lastname and month of birth.
+ It will make a random selection based on the 1st letter of each input.
+ It will return a console log displaying the original name, and new name.
+ no selections should be the same.
+ each coder should aim to use funny words to replace.(but no explicit words)

to use the Nickname Generator - run the javascript locally from a program for now.
### The Team.
